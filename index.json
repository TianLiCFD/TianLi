The PPBB burner employs a conical bluff body to stabilize the flame, and its design allows for the dilution of the fuel-air mixture by internally recirculated flue gas. The degree of premixing can be adjusted via primary and secondary fuel ports that are controlled independently. Steady-state computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were conducted for 12 different combinations of secondary fuel fractions and thermal loads to investigate the complex flow structure in the burner and the source of NOx formation. All simulations were validated against experimental data and underpredicted NOx emissions by 7% on average. A detailed analysis of the combustion characteristics was conducted and showed that primary fuel is burned in a multiregime mode at a wide range of mixture fractions/equivalence ratios, while secondary fuel is burned closer to stoichiometry. Utilizing a secondary fuel fraction of 30% (i.e., the base operational condition) leads to a fuel-rich mixture within the inner recirculation zone compared to a fuel-lean mixture when the burner is operated without secondary fuel. The concave mean curvature of the stoichiometric isosurface between primary and secondary fuel leads furthermore to a local peak of the NOx formation rate when the burner operates at its base conditions. The analysis of the mass flow rates in the inner and outer recirculation zones showed that increasing the thermal load reduces the amount of internally recirculated flue gas. The conducted simulations indicate that these effects contribute to an increase in NOx emissions with increasing thermal load and with increasing secondary fuel fraction. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","tags":null,"title":"Combustion and NOx Emission Characteristics of a Bluff Body Hydrogen Burner","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Guo","Tian Li","Lihao Zhao","Terese Løvås"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"543da0cffd451582885762920ae871ae","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/journal-article14/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article14/","section":"publication","summary":"Pulverized biomass has great potential to replace coal in many industrial systems such as suspension-firing furnaces and entrained-flow gasifiers. The shape of pulverized biomass deviates significantly from the quasi-spherical coal particle, however, it is common to simulate pulverized biomass particles as spheres as most biomass models are developed based on coal models. With the aim of obtaining a more realistic simulation of pulverized biomass, this work extends the treatment of pulverized biomass to spheroids. A spheroid model that accounts for spheroidal particle drag force and torque was implemented into an Eulerian-Lagrange computational fluid dynamic solver. Comprehensive verifications and validations were performed by comparing with experiments and direct numerical simulations. Furthermore, non-reactive simulations of a lab-scale entrained flow gasifier were carried out using a conventional spherical particle model, a simplified non-sphere model, and the implemented detailed spheroidal particle model. By studying the simulation results of particle and fluid velocities in axial, radial and tangential directions, differences were observed when comparing the sphere model, the simplified non-sphere model, and the spheroid model. The spheroid model shows that particle orientation, which is ignored in the sphere model and the simplified non-sphere model, plays a role in the behavior of the particle dynamics. It was also found that, under such conditions, the spheroid model, compared to the sphere model, yields a more dispersed distribution regarding the particle residence time and local concentration. These non-reactive simulation results imply that shortcomings may exist in the common practice of simulating conversion of pulverized biomass in which the sphere model or the simplified non-sphere model is applied. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","tags":null,"title":"Eulerian-Lagrangian simulation of pulverized biomass jet using spheroidal particle approximation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With GAFT we aim to swiftly introduce liquid biofuels production in the Norwegian market through local production\nThe challenges is to be able to make the overall process economically viable at a scale that is suitable for Norway and by taking into account the Norwegian conditions and existing infrastructure.

NOx, particulate and CO emissions are special concerns, as well as the operational challenges following particle deposition on heat transfer surfaces. The majority of the operational BtE and WtE plants in Norway are grate fired plants, and even though different grate technologies have been developed, they suffer from both variations in fuel quality and changing operating conditions, resulting in non-optimum operating conditions. The most cost-effective measure to abate the resulting operational challenges, including increased emission levels, are with primary measures.\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the ultimate design tool for BtE and WtE plant combustion and heat transfer sections, however, cost-effective sub-models need to be developed, implemented and used in an optimum way.

Despite innumerable studies previously conducted on gasification of biomass, very few have focused on such conditions. Consequently, in this study the high-temperature gasification behaviors of biomass-derived chars were investigated using non-intrusive techniques. Two biomass chars produced at a heating rate of approximately 104 K/s were subjected to two gasification environments and one oxidation environment in an entrained flow reactor equipped with an optical particle-sizing pyrometer. A coal char produced from a common U.S. low sulfur subbituminous coal was also studied for comparison. Both char and surrounding gas temperatures were precisely measured along the centerline of the furnace. Despite differences in the physical and chemical properties of the biomass chars, they exhibited rather similar reaction temperatures under all investigated conditions. On the other hand, a slightly lower particle temperature was observed in the case of coal char gasification, suggesting a higher gasification reactivity for the coal char. A comprehensive numerical model was applied to aid the understanding of the conversion of the investigated chars under gasification atmospheres. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the influence of four parameters (gas temperature, char diameter, char density, and steam concentration) on the carbon conversion rate. The results demonstrate that the gas temperature is the most important single variable influencing the gasification rate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","tags":null,"title":"High temperature gasification of high heating-rate chars using a flat-flame reactor","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My tasks: study diesel spray combustion characteristics by using Shell and EBU model\n","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"926c4966eda5f3113e5fe74dcb74af53","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/nsfc-50676055/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nsfc-50676055/","section":"project","summary":"Study on Combustion and Emission Characteristics of High Pressure Diesel Fuel Spray in Controllable Active Thermo-Atmosphere","tags":null,"title":"NSFC 50676055","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My tasks: preliminary estimation of engine efficiency\n","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"ec415b3d2da5c36ae51560d1617de185","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/nsfc-50946052/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nsfc-50946052/","section":"project","summary":"Study on Zero Emission Internal Combustion Engine Using Rankine Cycle","tags":null,"title":"NSFC 50946052","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My tasks: numerical study on combustion and emission characteristics of oxygenated fuel by using detailed chemical kinetic mechanism, study on effect of chemical additive on ethanol and DME combustion, jet diffusion ethanol flame simulation in active thermo atmosphere by using flamelet model\n","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"fdc7cc6b8767c250cdd68f469d8e6419","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/nsfc-51006075/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nsfc-51006075/","section":"project","summary":"Study on Low Temperature Combustion and Emission Characteristics of Bio-Fuel Based on Critical Temperature","tags":null,"title":"NSFC 51006075","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"SiNoPSE is a Sino-Norwegian Partnership on Sustainable Energy between Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and Tsinghua University (THU).

Strategies for emission control can be developed from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. This, furthermore, requires a computational efficient kinetic model that is able to capture both formation and destruction of NOx in a wide range of conditions. In this work, three skeletal mechanisms with varying degrees of reduction were developed based on a detailed kinetics model proposed recently (148 species and 2764 reactions). By preserving all major reaction pathways of NO formation, the most comprehensive skeletal mechanism Li45 (45 species and 788 reactions) behaved very similar compared to the base mechanism with regard to the prediction of NO. The more compact skeletal mechanism Li37 (37 species and 303 reactions) was generated specifically for the conditions relevant to large scale industrial combustion of solid fuels. The Li37 mechanism is capable of predicting NO formation as well as simulating common measures of NOx reduction such as the staged combustion and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). Without the consideration of SNCR, the smallest skeletal mechanism Li32 (32 species and 255 reactions) still maintained a good predictability over broad temperature and excess air ratio ranges. Compared to the base mechanism, the skeletal mechanisms achieved over 70% reduction in species. Furthermore, the computational cost was lowered to a large extent, particularly with Li37 and Li32. This makes the developed skeletal mechanisms very suitable to be implemented in CFD simulations. © 2019 The Authors","tags":null,"title":"Skeletal mechanisms for prediction of NOx emission in solid fuel combustion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Biomass gasification coupled with catalytic fuel synthesis has been identified as the most promising, closets to commercialization and most viable technology for production of 2nd generation transportation fuels. However, to this day, there are very few truly commercial gasifiers, operating without government support or subsidies, day in, day out, generating useful gas from biomass and even fewer that are integrated with fuel synthesis. The main reason for this is products of incomplete gasification (soot, tars, and char).\nProducts of incomplete gasification are responsible for fouling in process equipment; they contaminate and/or deactivate catalytic reactors and reduce the overall energy efficiency of gasification installations. More importantly, they introduce an uncertainty; of poor gasification performance, of poor process economy, of difficult plant engineering etc. Most importantly, this uncertainty, can lead to that companies are unwilling to invest in the gasification technology. As long as this uncertainty is present, 2nd generation biofuels produced via gasification will remain a promising, viable, on the paper technology.\nIn this research project we wish to change this by addressing the uncertainties in biomass gasification directly. We will use advanced computational methods and new experimental infrastructure to address the Achilles heel of biomass gasification.
