Our previous work has found that the spheroid model predicts more dispersed results in terms of particle velocities and local concentrations comparing to other conventional particle models under non-reactive conditions. This work takes the spheroid model one step further, by validating against experiments performed under reactive conditions with a newly implemented heat transfer model for spheroids as well as updated devolatilization kinetic parameters. In addition, simulations were conducted in a configuration similar to a pilot-scale entrained flow gasifier for more realistic scenarios. Particle mass and axial velocity development were compared accordingly using four different modelling approaches with increasing complexity. When compared with models of spheroidal shape assumptions, the sphere and simplified non-sphere model predict 61% and 43% longer residence times, respectively. The combination of the spheroid shape assumption with the heat transfer model for spheroids tends to promote drying and devolatilization. On the other hand, the traditional spherical approach leads to longer particle residence times. These opposing effects are believed to be a major contributing factor to the fact that no significant differences among modelling approaches were found in terms of syngas production at the outlet. Furthermore, particle orientation information was reported in both experiments and simulations under reactive conditions. Its dependency on gas velocity gradient under reactive conditions is similar to what was reported under non-reactive conditions. © 2020 The Authors","tags":null,"title":"Computational fluid dynamic simulations of thermochemical conversion of pulverized biomass in a dilute flow using spheroidal approximation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Meraner","Tian Li","Mario Ditaranto","Terese Løvås"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580342400,"objectID":"51c3483c750071a8a5ad3498df815da1","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/journal-article19/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article19/","section":"publication","summary":"The effect of constant velocity and constant residence time scaling on the local nitric oxide (NOx) emissions and flame characteristics of complex partial premixed hydrogen burners were investigated numerically and theoretically. A previously developed and validated computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was employed to conduct in total 11 simulations at various burner scales ranging from a base case of 10 kW to an up-scaled burner design at 500 kW. The flame characteristics were investigated by means of a novel CFD based regime diagram and compared to Damköhler and Karlovitz numbers obtained from scaling theory. The flame is at laboratory scale mainly characterized by the thin reaction zone regime. Employing constant velocity scaling was predicted to overall decrease the Karlovitz number, which causes the combustion to appear partially in the corrugated flamelet regime and at scales exceeding 250 kW also in the wrinkled flamelet regime. Constant residence time scaling on the other hand leads overall to a combustion with constant Damköhler numbers. However, a constant Karlovitz number close to unity was observed for a significant part of the flame-sheet, which leads in this flame regions to a variable Damköhler number. Both investigated scaling principles lead to an increase of the overall NOx emissions, with constant velocity scaling resulting in the highest emissions. This is mainly attributed to the larger volumes and longer residence times of the flame and immediate post flame region compared to constant residence time scaling. The total NOx formation in the inner recirculation zone, on the other hand, is lower for constant velocity scaling and is found to be dominated by the local oxygen atom (O) and hydroxyl (OH) concentration. Constant velocity scaling causes a breakup of the inner recirculation zone at the 500 kW scale, which leads to a fundamentally different flow field and causes the flame to impinge onto the combustion chamber wall, whereas constant residence time scaling maintains the inner recirculation zone at all investigated scales. The breakup of the recirculation zone is attributed to the different effect of the scaling principles on the velocity to length scale ratio and momentum of the annular jet flow. © 2020","tags":null,"title":"Effects of scaling laws on the combustion and NOx characteristics of hydrogen burners","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingyuan Zhang","Tian Li","Henrik Ström","Terese Løvås"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578528000,"objectID":"fb83f9466f10954c675d34470f34a078","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/journal-article20/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article20/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with three coarse graining algorithms is developed with the implementation of a layer based thermally thick particle model.

A model, which can calculate devolatilization times and particle temperatures for both spherical and cylindrical particles of a wide size range is established, and modeling predictions are compared to experimental data from literature with good consistency. The model accounts for the influence of aspect ratio and allows for biomass particles to be modeled as cylinders; a more accurate representation than the classical spherical approach. If a spherical approach is desirable due to limitations in computational costs, it is found to be more accurate to retain the diameter of the cylindrical biomass particle in the calculations rather than to adjust the radius to create a sphere with the same volume as the original particle. An analysis of the relative effect on devolatilization time of relevant physical parameters for three particle sizes (dp = 79 μm, 0.8 mm, and 3.1 mm) is presented, evaluating both kinetic and heat transfer limitations. In general, model results show that the time for full devolatilization varies with more than two orders of magnitude in the particle size range (dp = 0.08–3 mm) relevant for suspension firing. For the relevant gas temperature (Tg = 1300–1900 K) and density (ρ = 400–1000 kg/m3) intervals, the devolatilization times approximately doubles within both interval ranges.

Owing to the thermally thick nature, it is particularly expensive to simulate the conversion of large fuel particles such as biomass particles. To address this issue, a fast-solving particle model was developed in this work with special attention to the computational efficiency. The model spatially discretizes a fuel particle in one homogenized dimension. The conversion process of the fuel particle is treated as a reactive variable-volume one-dimensional transient heat conduction problem. The model also utilizes several features that are typically found in sharp interphase-based models to reduce the computational cost. Validation of the model was carried out by comparing with experimental results under both pyrolysis and combustion conditions. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the model was thoroughly examined by varying the degrees of temporal and spatial discretization. It was found that the model well predicted pyrolysis and combustion of a single biomass particle within a broad range of temporal and spatial discretization. The time used to simulate the conversion of a biomass particle using the developed model can be more than one order of magnitude smaller than the conversion process itself. It was also revealed that a well-predicted conductive heat transfer inside the particle is essential for a precise simulation of the drying and devolatilization process. The char conversion process, however, is less sensitive to the external heat transfer as it is mainly controlled by the mass diffusion process. Further studies showed that a time step of 1×10−3 s and a spatial discretization of 20 cells were sufficient for simulating the conversion of typical fuel particles in grate-fired and fluidized-bed furnaces. We also demonstrated that when the particle model was implemented in a CFD solver, only 2.2% of computational overhead was introduced by the model. As the model can efficiently employ fixed time stepping, optimal load balancing during parallel computing of many simultaneous conversion processes becomes trivial. This performance opens up new possibilities for treating fuel polydispersity in Eulerian CFD simulations of biomass conversion.","tags":null,"title":"A fast-solving particle model for thermochemical conversion of biomass","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tian Li","Øyvind Skreiberg","Terese Løvås","Peter Glarborg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560384000,"objectID":"c7fc0c1f274283a99c8b0d9029485de1","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/journal-article16/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article16/","section":"publication","summary":"Emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is a major challenge for combustion of solid fuels.

In this work, three skeletal mechanisms with varying degrees of reduction were developed based on a detailed kinetics model proposed recently (148 species and 2764 reactions). By preserving all major reaction pathways of NO formation, the most comprehensive skeletal mechanism Li45 (45 species and 788 reactions) behaved very similar compared to the base mechanism with regard to the prediction of NO. The more compact skeletal mechanism Li37 (37 species and 303 reactions) was generated specifically for the conditions relevant to large scale industrial combustion of solid fuels. The Li37 mechanism is capable of predicting NO formation as well as simulating common measures of NOx reduction such as the staged combustion and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). Without the consideration of SNCR, the smallest skeletal mechanism Li32 (32 species and 255 reactions) still maintained a good predictability over broad temperature and excess air ratio ranges. Compared to the base mechanism, the skeletal mechanisms achieved over 70% reduction in species. Furthermore, the computational cost was lowered to a large extent, particularly with Li37 and Li32.

In addition to temperatures, residence times and primary and overall excess air ratio, the fuel-N content and speciation, the relative fuel-C, fuel-H and fuel-O contents, the fuel moisture content, the fuel gas composition from the dry fuel and the use of FGR (in the primary and/or secondary combustion zone) influence the NOx reduction potential to a larger or smaller extent. To assess the influence of different parameters, a simulation matrix using one ideal plug flow reactor representing only the primary zone and a recent detailed chemical kinetics mechanism was carried out. The results show a large influence of the fuel-N content and speciation on the NOx reduction potential in the primary zone, and a significant influence of the fuel moisture content due to its fuel gas dilution effect. At the close to optimum NOx reduction conditions studied in this work (973 K, primary excess air ratio of 0.9), the influence of the fuel gas composition from the dry fuel on the achievable total fixed nitrogen reduction in the primary zone is relatively small, as well as its influence on the radical pool available for the fuel-N chemistry. The influence of the relative content of C, H and O in the fuel at a constant primary excess air ratio is also relatively small. From a kinetics point of view, there is a positive effect of applying under grate flue gas recirculation if the residence time is sufficiently long, however, the effect is relatively low compared to the other main influencing parameters. At higher temperatures the importance of the radical pool availability as well as its speciation increases, and a more significant part of the NH3 and especially HCN reduction in the primary zone results in increasing NO formation with increasing temperature.

The PPBB burner employs a conical bluff body to stabilize the flame, and its design allows for the dilution of the fuel-air mixture by internally recirculated flue gas. The degree of premixing can be adjusted via primary and secondary fuel ports that are controlled independently. Steady-state computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were conducted for 12 different combinations of secondary fuel fractions and thermal loads to investigate the complex flow structure in the burner and the source of NOx formation. All simulations were validated against experimental data and underpredicted NOx emissions by 7% on average. A detailed analysis of the combustion characteristics was conducted and showed that primary fuel is burned in a multiregime mode at a wide range of mixture fractions/equivalence ratios, while secondary fuel is burned closer to stoichiometry. Utilizing a secondary fuel fraction of 30% (i.e., the base operational condition) leads to a fuel-rich mixture within the inner recirculation zone compared to a fuel-lean mixture when the burner is operated without secondary fuel. The concave mean curvature of the stoichiometric isosurface between primary and secondary fuel leads furthermore to a local peak of the NOx formation rate when the burner operates at its base conditions. The analysis of the mass flow rates in the inner and outer recirculation zones showed that increasing the thermal load reduces the amount of internally recirculated flue gas. The conducted simulations indicate that these effects contribute to an increase in NOx emissions with increasing thermal load and with increasing secondary fuel fraction. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","tags":null,"title":"Combustion and NOx Emission Characteristics of a Bluff Body Hydrogen Burner","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The overall objective of this project is to optimise the biocarbon value chain for the metallurgical industry through:\n Production of biocarbon with sufficient quality satisfying the end user quality requirements while ensuring optimum utilisation of the by-products.

Technologies for reducing NOx emissions based on flue gas cleaning using e.g. Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) or Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are well known. However, limiting NOx emissions by primary measures is an attractive opportunity, avoiding or limiting the use of costly secondary measures. Many factors influence the NOx emission level from biomass and MSW combustion plants, like fuel-N content and speciation, and operating parameters as air distribution and staging, flue gas recirculation, temperature and residence time. In this work a recent detailed chemical kinetics mechanism is used to investigate the NOx reduction potential by staged air combustion at different operational conditions, using two ideal plug flow reactors connected in series. This enables revealing a kinetics limited reduction potential, as a guideline for further detailed studies at targeted conditions using stochastic reactor networks or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results show, for demolition wood as fuel, a large NOx reduction potential, as high as above 95% total fixed nitrogen reduction at theoretically optimum conditions. Through reaction path analyses the main reaction pathways and reactions are identified. Comparison with experimental results from grate combustion units is made. Finally, a comparison with earlier and less extensive detailed chemical kinetics mechanisms is made, to check for significant differences and assess the reasons for those. The final goal would be to arrive at computationally effective reduced chemical kinetics mechanisms that could be applied in CFD simulations of real biomass and MSW combustion plants, to arrive at improved operational conditions or improved design. © 2019 The Authors.

The shape of pulverized biomass deviates significantly from the quasi-spherical coal particle, however, it is common to simulate pulverized biomass particles as spheres as most biomass models are developed based on coal models. With the aim of obtaining a more realistic simulation of pulverized biomass, this work extends the treatment of pulverized biomass to spheroids. A spheroid model that accounts for spheroidal particle drag force and torque was implemented into an Eulerian-Lagrange computational fluid dynamic solver. Comprehensive verifications and validations were performed by comparing with experiments and direct numerical simulations. Furthermore, non-reactive simulations of a lab-scale entrained flow gasifier were carried out using a conventional spherical particle model, a simplified non-sphere model, and the implemented detailed spheroidal particle model. By studying the simulation results of particle and fluid velocities in axial, radial and tangential directions, differences were observed when comparing the sphere model, the simplified non-sphere model, and the spheroid model. The spheroid model shows that particle orientation, which is ignored in the sphere model and the simplified non-sphere model, plays a role in the behavior of the particle dynamics. It was also found that, under such conditions, the spheroid model, compared to the sphere model, yields a more dispersed distribution regarding the particle residence time and local concentration. These non-reactive simulation results imply that shortcomings may exist in the common practice of simulating conversion of pulverized biomass in which the sphere model or the simplified non-sphere model is applied. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","tags":null,"title":"Eulerian-Lagrangian simulation of pulverized biomass jet using spheroidal particle approximation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kathrin Weber","Sebastian Heuer","Peter Quicker","Tian Li","Terese Løvås","Viktor Scherer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533859200,"objectID":"3a6b5cdecc572013db6407c4fa8b5735","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/journal-article12/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article12/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, a novel approach for the determination of the solid mass yield from slow pyrolysis based on a comparison of the volatile matter contents of feedstock and char is presented.

Consequently, in this study the high-temperature gasification behaviors of biomass-derived chars were investigated using non-intrusive techniques. Two biomass chars produced at a heating rate of approximately 104 K/s were subjected to two gasification environments and one oxidation environment in an entrained flow reactor equipped with an optical particle-sizing pyrometer. A coal char produced from a common U.S. low sulfur subbituminous coal was also studied for comparison. Both char and surrounding gas temperatures were precisely measured along the centerline of the furnace. Despite differences in the physical and chemical properties of the biomass chars, they exhibited rather similar reaction temperatures under all investigated conditions. On the other hand, a slightly lower particle temperature was observed in the case of coal char gasification, suggesting a higher gasification reactivity for the coal char. A comprehensive numerical model was applied to aid the understanding of the conversion of the investigated chars under gasification atmospheres. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the influence of four parameters (gas temperature, char diameter, char density, and steam concentration) on the carbon conversion rate. The results demonstrate that the gas temperature is the most important single variable influencing the gasification rate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","tags":null,"title":"High temperature gasification of high heating-rate chars using a flat-flame reactor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tiina Keipi","Tian Li","Henrik Tolvanen","Terese Løvås","Jukka Konttinen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499126400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499126400,"objectID":"9ee8cdf4d7fec32018ba9eceacf4cbb7","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/journal-article9/","publishdate":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article9/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, thermal decomposition of methane (TDM) was experimentally studied at nominal gas temperatures of 1070 K–1450 K in a non-catalytic laboratory test reactor. The purpose was to use a simple kinetic mechanism to describe the TDM reaction, which could be applied in industrial reactor design. The experimental data was utilized to optimize global kinetic parameters describing the TDM reaction in the test reactor. For comparison, a 37-step reaction mechanism for TDM was adopted from the literature. When analyzing experimental datasets from the literature, the optimized global kinetics provided better agreement with the experimental data than the 37-step mechanism when the reactor temperature profiles were defined in detail. Since the 37-step mechanism was not able to predict the solid carbon formation well enough, the mechanism was slightly adjusted according to a reaction flow and sensitivity analysis. Additionally, it was suggested that the 37-step mechanism can be improved by optimizing the reaction mechanism by using a detailed experimental data of hydrocarbon formation in TDM achieved in an environment where the temperature profiles are fully defined. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","tags":null,"title":"Methane thermal decomposition in regenerative heat exchanger reactor: Experimental and modeling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tian Li","Xiaoke Ku","Terese Løvås"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"d2deff300b0bdbc9fea24c7915add91f","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/proceeding-article7/","publishdate":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/proceeding-article7/","section":"publication","summary":"In the present work, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is used to assess devolatilization of biomass under high-temperature condition.

However, to this day, there are very few truly commercial gasifiers, operating without government support or subsidies, day in, day out, generating useful gas from biomass and even fewer that are integrated with fuel synthesis. The main reason for this is products of incomplete gasification (soot, tars, and char).\nProducts of incomplete gasification are responsible for fouling in process equipment; they contaminate and/or deactivate catalytic reactors and reduce the overall energy efficiency of gasification installations. More importantly, they introduce an uncertainty; of poor gasification performance, of poor process economy, of difficult plant engineering etc. Most importantly, this uncertainty, can lead to that companies are unwilling to invest in the gasification technology. As long as this uncertainty is present, 2nd generation biofuels produced via gasification will remain a promising, viable, on the paper technology.\nIn this research project we wish to change this by addressing the uncertainties in biomass gasification directly. We will use advanced computational methods and new experimental infrastructure to address the Achilles heel of biomass gasification. We aim to show (experimentally and numerically) that energy efficiency (and thus competitiveness and economy) in biomass gasification can be improved by using results obtained from fundamental research methods.\nThe international team of researchers in this project will provide a fundamental research base for current and future competence building projects and establish a communication bridge between universities, research institutes and industry thus accelerating the acceptance and confidence in the gasification technology.\nMy Tasks: SP leader on idealized particle experiments and CFD simulations; developing simplified soot formation model; developing CFD solvers for simulating gasification of biomass; performing experimental studies on high-temperature biomass gasification\nProject website\n","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491004800,"objectID":"928ae7fe19e9ecaaf3cf81256e213c7b","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/gaspro/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gaspro/","section":"project","summary":"Fundamental insight into biomass gasification using experiments and mathematical modelling","tags":null,"title":"GASPRO","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Biomass to energy (BtE) and waste to energy (WtE) plants in Norway need to comply with stricter emission limits and/or adjust to tighter profit margins, and EU have implemented a further reduction of emission limits from medium (scale) combustion plants.\nTighter profit margins mean that poorer/cheaper fuel qualities become interesting, as well as operational optimization with respect to efficiency and capacity maximization. NOx, particulate and CO emissions are special concerns, as well as the operational challenges following particle deposition on heat transfer surfaces. The majority of the operational BtE and WtE plants in Norway are grate fired plants, and even though different grate technologies have been developed, they suffer from both variations in fuel quality and changing operating conditions, resulting in non-optimum operating conditions. The most cost-effective measure to abate the resulting operational challenges, including increased emission levels, are with primary measures.\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the ultimate design tool for BtE and WtE plant combustion and heat transfer sections, however, cost-effective sub-models need to be developed, implemented and used in an optimum way.

The methodology is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian concept, which uses an Eulerian method for gas phase and a discrete element method (DEM) for particle phase. Each particle is individually tracked and associated with multiple physical (size, density, composition, and temperature) and thermo-chemical (reactive or inert) properties. Particle collisions, hydrodynamics of dense gas-particle flow in fluidized beds, turbulence, heat and mass transfer, radiation, particle shrinkage, pyrolysis, and homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions are all considered during biomass gasification with steam. A sensitivity analysis is performed to test the integrated model[U+05F3]s response to variations in three different operating parameters (reactor temperature, steam/biomass mass ratio, and biomass injection position). Simulation results are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of particle flow pattern, particle mixing and entrainment, bed pressure drop, product gas composition, and carbon conversion. Results show that higher temperatures are favorable for the products in endothermic reactions (e.g. H2 and CO). With the increase of steam/biomass mass ratio, H2 and CO2 concentrations increase while CO concentration decreases. The carbon conversion decreases as the height of injection point increases owing to both an increase of solid entrainment and a decrease of particle residence time and particle temperature. Meanwhile, the calculated results compare well with the experimental data available in the literature. This indicates that the proposed CFD-DEM model and simulations are successful and it can play an important role in the multi-scale modeling of biomass gasification or combustion in fluidized bed reactor. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","tags":null,"title":"CFD-DEM simulation of biomass gasification with steam in a fluidized bed reactor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoke Ku","Tian Li","Terese Løvås"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1405036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1405036800,"objectID":"d5d20be84aa461b6d2f1df8ef2a1336c","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/journal-article2/","publishdate":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article2/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a multiscale Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD model based on OpenFOAM has been constructed, which takes into account heat and mass transfer, pyrolysis, homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, radiation, as well as the interactions between the continuous gas phase and discrete particles. The proposed model is validated and applied to a laboratory-scale biomass entrained-flow reactor. The operating temperatures are high (1000-1400°C) and influences of five operating parameters (reactor temperature, steam/carbon molar ratio, excess air ratio, biomass type, and particle size) on the gasification behavior are explored. Results show that an increase in the reactor temperature has a positive effect on both the H2 and CO productions; increasing the steam/carbon ratio increases the H2 production but decreases the CO production; increasing the excess air ratio decreases both the H2 and CO productions; the variations in the gas product for the four biomasses studied are not so significant, because of similar biomass nature and, hence, one type can be replaced by another without any major consequences in the gasification performance; and both the CO and H2 productions and carbon conversion decrease with an increase in particle size. Moreover, the predicted results follow the same trend as the experimental data available in the literature. Quantitative comparisons are also made, and the agreement is good. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","tags":null,"title":"Eulerian–Lagrangian Simulation of Biomass Gasification Behavior in a High-Temperature Entrained-Flow Reactor","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The overall objective of BioCarb+ is development of new strategies for use of low-grade biomass, pulpwood and energy wood resources for biocarbon (BC) production for raw material for industrial applications (reduction agent / metallurgical coke) and conversion for energy purposes.

The inter-particle and particle-wall collisions are modeled by a soft-sphere model which expresses the contact forces with the use of a spring, dashpot and friction slider. The simulation results are analyzed in terms of particle flow pattern, bed expansion, bed pressure drop and fluctuation frequency. Qualitatively, formation of bubbles and slugs and the process of particle mixing are observed to occur for all the drag models, although the Gidaspow model is found to be most energetic and the Di Felice and EHKL models yield minor difference. The flow behavior also shows a strong dependency on the restitution coefficient e and the friction coefficient μ and no bubbling and slugging occur at all for the ideal-collision case (e=1, μ=0). Quantitatively, the mean pressure drops predicted by the three models agree quite well with each other and the amplitudes of the fluctuations measured by the standard deviation are also comparable. However, a significant difference in fluctuation frequency is found and the Gidaspow model predicts a lowest fluctuation frequency whereas the Di Felice model gets a highest one. Finally, effects of the spring stiffness and the discontinuity in the Gidaspow model are studied. The results show that both mean bed pressure drop and fluctuation frequency slightly decrease as the spring stiffness increases for all the three drag models and no significant differences are observed in the mean bed pressure drop and fluctuation frequency between the Gidaspow model and the linear continuous model. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of drag force correlations on periodic fluidization behavior in Eulerian-Lagrangian simulation of a bubbling fluidized bed","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoke Ku","Tian Li","Terese Løvås"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1347580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1347580800,"objectID":"7b2bf16d9172e69419b694fc1d7e57d8","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/publication/proceeding-article2/","publishdate":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/proceeding-article2/","section":"publication","summary":"An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is developed within the OpenFOAM frame-work to investigate the effects of three well-known inter-phase drag force correlations on the fluidization behavior in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor.
