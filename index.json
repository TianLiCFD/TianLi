NOx, particulate and CO emissions are special concerns, as well as the operational challenges following particle deposition on heat transfer surfaces. The majority of the operational BtE and WtE plants in Norway are grate fired plants, and even though different grate technologies have been developed, they suffer from both variations in fuel quality and changing operating conditions, resulting in non-optimum operating conditions. The most cost-effective measure to abate the resulting operational challenges, including increased emission levels, are with primary measures.\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the ultimate design tool for BtE and WtE plant combustion and heat transfer sections, however, cost-effective sub-models need to be developed, implemented and used in an optimum way. Moreover, the CFD simulations need to be carried out for transient conditions, to study the effect of changing operating conditions, and minimize the impact of these through improved plant operation and operational guidelines.\nGrateCFD therefore focuses on enabling optimum grate fired BtE and WtE plant operation through CFD aided design and operational guidelines. Improved models and modelling approaches, in combination with targeted experiments/measurement campaigns, are keys for future\u0026rsquo;s increased sustainable BtE and WtE plants. This will have a significant impact on two of the most important renewable value chains in Norway today, the BtE and WtE value chains.\nMy tasks: developing fuel bed model and reduced NOx kinetics model; supervising a PhD student on CFD modelling of biomass/waste to energy plants\nProject website\n","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"3c4357e6b498be1a513a45748e164f22","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/gratecfd/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gratecfd/","section":"project","summary":"Enabling optimum Grate fired woody biomass and waste to energy plant operation through Computational Fluid Dynamics","tags":null,"title":"GrateCFD","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My tasks: study diesel spray combustion characteristics by using Shell and EBU model\n","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"926c4966eda5f3113e5fe74dcb74af53","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/nsfc-50676055/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nsfc-50676055/","section":"project","summary":"Study on Combustion and Emission Characteristics of High Pressure Diesel Fuel Spray in Controllable Active Thermo-Atmosphere","tags":null,"title":"NSFC 50676055","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My tasks: preliminary estimation of engine efficiency\n","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"ec415b3d2da5c36ae51560d1617de185","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/nsfc-50946052/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nsfc-50946052/","section":"project","summary":"Study on Zero Emission Internal Combustion Engine Using Rankine Cycle","tags":null,"title":"NSFC 50946052","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My tasks: numerical study on combustion and emission characteristics of oxygenated fuel by using detailed chemical kinetic mechanism, study on effect of chemical additive on ethanol and DME combustion, jet diffusion ethanol flame simulation in active thermo atmosphere by using flamelet model\n","date":1574208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574208000,"objectID":"fdc7cc6b8767c250cdd68f469d8e6419","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/nsfc-51006075/","publishdate":"2019-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nsfc-51006075/","section":"project","summary":"Study on Low Temperature Combustion and Emission Characteristics of Bio-Fuel Based on Critical Temperature","tags":null,"title":"NSFC 51006075","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"SiNoPSE is a Sino-Norwegian Partnership on Sustainable Energy between Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and Tsinghua University (THU).

However, to this day, there are very few truly commercial gasifiers, operating without government support or subsidies, day in, day out, generating useful gas from biomass and even fewer that are integrated with fuel synthesis. The main reason for this is products of incomplete gasification (soot, tars, and char).\nProducts of incomplete gasification are responsible for fouling in process equipment; they contaminate and/or deactivate catalytic reactors and reduce the overall energy efficiency of gasification installations. More importantly, they introduce an uncertainty; of poor gasification performance, of poor process economy, of difficult plant engineering etc. Most importantly, this uncertainty, can lead to that companies are unwilling to invest in the gasification technology. As long as this uncertainty is present, 2nd generation biofuels produced via gasification will remain a promising, viable, on the paper technology.\nIn this research project we wish to change this by addressing the uncertainties in biomass gasification directly. We will use advanced computational methods and new experimental infrastructure to address the Achilles heel of biomass gasification. We aim to show (experimentally and numerically) that energy efficiency (and thus competitiveness and economy) in biomass gasification can be improved by using results obtained from fundamental research methods.\nThe international team of researchers in this project will provide a fundamental research base for current and future competence building projects and establish a communication bridge between universities, research institutes and industry thus accelerating the acceptance and confidence in the gasification technology.\nMy Tasks: SP leader on idealized particle experiments and CFD simulations; developing simplified soot formation model; developing CFD solvers for simulating gasification of biomass; performing experimental studies on high-temperature biomass gasification\nProject website\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"928ae7fe19e9ecaaf3cf81256e213c7b","permalink":"https://tianlicfd.github.io/project/gaspro/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gaspro/","section":"project","summary":"Fundamental insight into biomass gasification using experiments and mathematical modelling","tags":null,"title":"GASPRO","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tian Li"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
