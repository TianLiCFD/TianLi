abstract={This paper investigates the performance of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model on dispersion of particles in wall turbulence. A direct numerical simula-tion of wall-bounded channel flow with particles suspensions was set as a benchmark. The standard k-Ï‰ model coupled with two different eddy interaction models was used in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model and compared to the direct numerical simulation. Detailed comparisons between direct numerical simulation and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model on particle distribution evolving over time were carried out.},
