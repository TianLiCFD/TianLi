abstract={In the work reported here, both forest residue (FR) and torrefied forest residue (TFR) were devolatilized in a drop tube reactor at 1473 K at a heating rate greater than 104 K/s. The physical properties of parent fuel particles and their corresponding char particles were examined by using a scanning electron microscope and a granulometer. After the same milling and sieving process, the TFR particles had a smaller size and smaller aspect ratio than the FR particles. The char particles consisted of two types of particles with different sizes and morphologies: a small particle mode (presumably char fragments) and a large particle mode. The volume fraction of char fragments in the TFR char was considerably less than for the FR char. Both types of char were converted in a drop tube reactor under oxidation and gasification conditions at 1473 and 1573 K, respectively. The total organic mass loss and release of individual organic elements during char conversion were determined using a tracer method. Calcium, manganese, barium, and magnesium were found to be suitable for use as tracers. The fractional carbon conversion rate of TFR char was found to be slower than that of FR char under both oxidation and gasification conditions. The fractional release rate of hydrogen was much higher than that of total organic mass loss, while the corresponding oxygen release was lower for both types of char and for different reactive environments. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},
