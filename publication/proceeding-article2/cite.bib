abstract={An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is developed within the OpenFOAM frame-work to investigate the effects of three well-known inter-phase drag force correlations on the fluidization behavior in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The results show a strong dependency on the restitution coefficient and the friction coefficient and no occurrence of bubbling and slugging for the ideal-collision case. The mean pressure drops predicted by the three models agree quite well with each other.},
