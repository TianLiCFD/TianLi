abstract={The combustion properties of spruce chars and spruce forest residue chars were studied in the kinetic regime by a series of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments. The work aimed at establishing how the pressure of the char preparation affects the reactivity with oxygen. Parts of the chars were prepared from a thin layer of biomass in inert gas flow at atmospheric pressure and 0.8 MPa. Other chars were formed in a pressurized reactor by a flash carbonization method [ Antal, M. J., Jr.; Mochidzuki, K.; Paredes, L. S. Flash carbonization of biomass. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2003, 42 (16), 3690-3699, DOI: 10.1021/ie0301839 ]. Despite the differences in the preparation, remarkable similarities were observed in the combustion behavior of the samples. The kinetics of the char burnoff was described by assuming three partial reactions. A total of 18 experiments at three different temperature programs were evaluated by the method of least squares to obtain dependable kinetic model variants. A common activation energy of 150 kJ/mol gave a reasonable description for the three partial reactions in all experiments. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},
